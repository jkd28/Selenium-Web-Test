# Web Testing with Selenium
This project was an assignment for my Software Quality Assurance class at the University of Pittsburgh. The goal of the assignment was to create a web-test suite for an example web site with several known defects.  We were required to find at least 3 defects.  The class defined defects as a function of the system that did not comply with the written requirements we were provided.  

In order to find defects and test properly, I used the Selenium library in Java combined with the J-Unit framework.  This project acted as great exposure to the function and importance of testing applications on the web.  I learned not only how to exploit the requirements of a system to find edge and corner cases, but also how to use the tools provided by Java and Selenium specifically.
